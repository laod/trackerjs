trackerjs - A nodejs-based BitTorrent tracker

pre-reqs: node

 Clone the repo
 cd trackerjs
 node tracker.js

Obviously you will need torrents that lists your new tracker. In linux I
prefer mktorrent:

 mktorrent -a http://<yourhost>:8214/announce <file or dir>

Fair warning: this was an exercise to learn more about node and js. The code
is terrible, barely works (or may not work for anything but my test), and
implements the bare minimum necessary to allow BT peers to talk to one
another.

The most horrible hack can be found in byte_array.js. Does js truly not have
a binary-safe datatype?

I welcome code or conceptual contributions.

It borrows from Anton Ekblad's bencode.js. Thanks to him.
